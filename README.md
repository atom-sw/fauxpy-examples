![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/atom-sw/fauxpy-examples)

In this repository, we provide step-by-step instructions on
how to use FauxPy on some Python projects as examples.

FauxPy is an automated fault localization tool for Python, and it is
available as open source in the following repository, which
also includes FauxPy's user manual.

# 1.1 Using the Examples

At the moment, there is only one example in this repository,
which is [triangle_area](triangle_area). We plan to add
more examples, later.

Each example is in a separate directory that contains
a readme file (e.g.,
[triangle_area/README.md](triangle_area/README.md)), providing instructions
on how to use FauxPy on it.

To use each example (e.g., `triangle_area`):

1. Clone the current repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:atom-sw/fauxpy-examples.git
```

2. `cd` to the example's directory:

```
cd triangle_area
```

3. Follow the instructions in the example's readme file.


# 2. Mirrors

The current repository is a public mirror of our
internal private repository. We have two public
mirrors, which are as follows:
